# Hack_NCSU_2026: PhishNet (Hack-A-Thon Demo)

PhishNet is a Phishing Campaign/Training service for personal/individual use. Clients sign up with an email address and upload some of their emails for context and our AI powered service will send them personalized, fake scam emails. If users are tricked and do click one of the links, they will be notified that the email they just clicked was a fake/scam email and they will be redirected to training resources for avoiding those types of scams in the future.
